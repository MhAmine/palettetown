## Copyright 

The words Pokemon, pokedex and all the pokemon names (which are include in data in sysdata.rda) are copyrighted to Nintendo.

I have made this clear in the DESCRIPTION file. I have read and complied with the CRAN policies. 

However, I thought I would explicitely mention this here just in case there is a requirement I have not understood.
