## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Edited the Description field in DESCRIPTION to better reflect the use of ggplot2 and base graphics.
* Added trademark information in Description field in DESCRIPTION
* Added trademark information in Docs.

## Test environments
* ubuntu 14.04, R 3.2.2
* ubuntu 14.04, R-devel 2015-08-28 r69202
* win-builder, R-release 3.2.2 
* win-build, R-devel 2015-09-03 r69271

## R CMD check results

There were no warnings or notes.

## Copyright 

The words Pokemon, pokedex and all the pokemon names (which are include in data in sysdata.rda) are copyrighted to Nintendo.

I have made this clear in the DESCRIPTION file. I have read and complied with the CRAN policies. 

However, I thought I would explicitely mention this here just in case there is a requirement I have not understood.
