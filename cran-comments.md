## Copyright 

This was discussed during the submission of the first version of this package but I thought I would leave it here in case.

The words Pokemon, pokedex and all the pokemon names (which are include in data in sysdata.rda) are copyrighted to Nintendo.

I have made this clear in the DESCRIPTION file. I have read and complied with the CRAN policies.
